# Cloud-Fraction

Low clouds play an important role in regulating the temperature of the Earth. Low clouds reflect solar radiation, which cools the surface of the Earth. It is important to know whether as the Earth warms due to climate change, if these clouds form with more or less frequency. This project uses machine learning to predict cloud fraction. This data makes climate models more accurate, allowing for proper planning to deal with problems arising from the changing climate.

An Anaconda environment has been provided with the cloud_fraction.yml file. A GPU is required to run program.

Project done under Dr. Tianle Yuan in the NASA Climate and Radiation Laboratory.

## main.py

This file contains the code to run model. Run this file to use program.

## toolbox.py

This file contains helper functions for main file.

## models directory

This directory contains the trained model from the script.

## results directory

This directory contains the results from the test set.

## data directory

This directory contains the dataset for the model.

**Running the script will overwrite the files in the results and models directories if they are not saved elsewhere**
